# Ed: AI Tutor that Supports Learning

## Project Information
- **Project Name:** Ed: AI Tutor that Supports Learning
- **Team Members:** Muhammad Sohaib Anwar, Luka Danelia, Naveen Kumar Kandhasamy-palayam Kulanthaivel, Fidan Karimova, Lilly Marlene Siewert
- **Supervisor:** Julius Laak

## Motivation
Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) forms the foundation for understanding various learning aspects, including cognitive and metacognitive skills. SRL aims to enhance students' skills and facilitate their learning journey [4] [5]. The core of SRL is the Anticipation, Action, and Reflection (AAR) cycle, which focuses on improving transformative competencies. These stages encourage students to take responsibility for their learning, create new values, or expand their knowledge [3].

## Timeline
The following timeline outlines the next steps, which may adjust based on complexities in implementing the AAR cycle strategies:

1. Start implementing AI Tutor as a custom API - **23.10.2024**
2. Begin identifying a course at the University of Tartu for the experiment - **25.10.2024**
3. Complete AI Tutor implementation - **08.11.2024**
4. Execute the experiment - **11.11.2024** (depending on course availability)
5. Evaluate experiment results - **01.12.2024**

## Project Idea
The goal of this project is to create an AI Tutor that assists students across all stages of the AAR cycle [3]:

- **Anticipation Stage:** The AI Tutor helps students set deadlines and goals using strategic planning as the foundation.
- **Action Stage:** The tutor aids students in self-monitoring based on technology-based self-monitoring (TBSM) strategies, emphasizing cueing and recording functions [1].
- **Reflection Stage:** This stage focuses on causal attribution, encouraging students to recognize cause-effect patterns to better identify challenges [2].

## Experiment Overview
The experiment will involve two groups: a control group and an experiment group. The goal is to assess the impact of the AI Tutor on learning outcomes by comparing both groups through three phases of the learning cycle [6]:

- **Forethought Phase:** Analyze and recommend effective strategies for upcoming tasks (e.g., setting a study schedule).
- **Performance Phase:** Encourage self-control and provide real-time feedback on task progress (e.g., adjusting time allocation based on task difficulty).
- **Self-Reflection Phase:** Help students evaluate their performance and practice self-awareness and causal attribution (e.g., identifying reasons for success or failure).

### Evaluation
At the end of the experiment, students' performance will be measured using criteria such as:
- **Timeliness**: Percentage of tasks completed on time
- **Completeness**: Percentage of tasks successfully completed
- **Grade Performance**: Actual grades received on exams or homework

By comparing both groups, we aim to determine whether the AI Tutor significantly enhances learning outcomes and SRL skills.

## Detailed Experiment Description

### Forethought Phase
- **Task Analysis:** The AI Tutor assists with analyzing upcoming tasks (e.g., exams, homework).
- **Goal Setting:** Helps students create strategic plans with deadlines.
- **Study Strategy Recommendation:** Suggests strategies based on task type.

### Performance Phase
- **Self-Control:** Students adhere to the plan created in the forethought phase using techniques like attention focusing, self-instruction, and task strategies.
- **Self-Observation:** The AI Tutor monitors progress, provides feedback on distractions, and suggests improvements, such as changing the study environment. Students also update the AI Tutor upon task completion to calculate timeliness based on deadlines.

### Self-Reflection Phase
- **Self-Judgment:** Students evaluate their performance relative to their goals and peers. The AI Tutor focuses on causal attribution to help them understand the reasons behind their successes or failures.
- **Self-Reaction:** Students provide feedback on task completion (e.g., percentage of tasks completed), allowing the AI Tutor to assess performance.

### Evaluation
At the conclusion of the experiment, the following metrics will be used to evaluate both the control group and experiment group:

- **Timeliness:** Percentage of tasks completed by the deadline
- **Completeness:** Percentage of tasks successfully completed
- **Grade Performance:** Actual grades received

The performance comparison will reveal whether the AI Tutor had a significant impact on the students' learning outcomes and self-regulated learning skills.
